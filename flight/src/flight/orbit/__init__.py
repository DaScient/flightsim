"""
Orbital mechanics helpers for the flight library.

This subpackage exposes functions to compute gravitational
accelerations (two‑body and J2).  These functions can be used outside
of the full 6‑DOF integrator, for example in preliminary orbit
analysis or to verify results against analytic solutions.
